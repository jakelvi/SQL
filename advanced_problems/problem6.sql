/* Create three tables:
    Jan 2023 jobs
    Feb 2023 jobs
    Mar 2023 jobs
Forshadowing: This will be used in another practice problem below.

Hints:
    Use CREATE TABLE table_name AS syntax to create your table.
    Look at a way to filter out only specific months (EXTRACT) */

-- CREATE TABLE january_jobs AS
-- SELECT *

-- FROM 
--     job_postings_fact

-- WHERE 
--     EXTRACT(MONTH FROM job_posted_date) = 1 

-- CREATE TABLE february_jobs AS
-- SELECT *
-- FROM job_postings_fact
-- WHERE EXTRACT(MONTH FROM job_posted_date) = 2;


-- CREATE TABLE march_jobs AS
-- SELECT *
-- FROM job_postings_fact
-- WHERE EXTRACT(MONTH FROM job_posted_date) = 3;
